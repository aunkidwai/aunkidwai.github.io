At Eagletfly Solutions in Noida, from January to July 2023, I served as a Data Science and Personality Development Trainer. 

My role involved leading training sessions for a varied audience, including corporate clients and university students, focusing on data science basics, machine learning, and statistical analysis. I crafted engaging materials and interactive exercises to deepen understanding and practical skills in data science. Additionally, I continuously updated our training content to keep it current and effective while providing personalized mentoring to support learners' growth in the field. Collaboration with teams ensured our programs met industry demands and tailored to individual learning needs.
