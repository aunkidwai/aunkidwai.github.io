During my tenure from January to July 2023 at Softpro India in Lucknow, I wore dual hats as a Data Science and Personality Development Trainer. 

I led sessions on a spectrum of soft skills, including self-awareness, communication, emotional intelligence, leadership, and personal branding. Tailoring the programs to participant needs, I employed experiential learning techniques and interactive methods to ensure engagement and real-world application. Personalized coaching and continuous assessments were key to tracking progress and fostering individual development, all within a positive and inclusive learning atmosphere.
