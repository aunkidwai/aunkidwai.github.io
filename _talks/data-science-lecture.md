In March 2021, I conducted a "Roadmap to Data Science" lecture at Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University, Agra, targeting undergraduates, postgraduates, researchers, and professionals. 

This initiative aimed to demystify data science through a curriculum that covered its core concepts, techniques, and essential tools. By integrating practical examples and employing interactive teaching strategies, I showcased the field's wide-ranging applications and facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject. My efforts also extended to advising on the selection of programming tools, exploring career prospects within data science, and emphasizing the importance of ethical practices in data handling. The learning environment was designed to be engaging and supportive, encouraging curiosity and continuous learning through discussions and hands-on activities.
