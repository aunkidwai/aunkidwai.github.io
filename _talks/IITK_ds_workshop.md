In March 2023, I led a Data Science and AI workshop at IIT Kanpur, India, delivering comprehensive training to students. 

The program blended theoretical knowledge with practical exercises, including real-world case studies and coding projects, to offer a holistic understanding of the field. Collaborating with academia and industry experts, I ensured the curriculum stayed current with emerging trends. I also mentored participants on research projects, fostering hands-on learning and critical thinking. Through tailored assessments, we monitored progress and refined the workshops based on feedback, contributing significantly to the participants' learning journey in data science and AI.
